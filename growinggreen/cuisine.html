			<p><center> Growing Green Eatery's menu varies by season, so that our customers can experience new dishes every time they come into our restaurant. 
			We use fresh, all natural ingredients that we grow ourselves in the greenhouse attached to the dining room.  This results in low calorie healthy foods 
			that taste great, and that you do not have to feel guilty about.  There is a childrenâ€™s menu for children twelve and under and specials are
			offered on Sundays for senior citizens.  If there is a meal that you would like that is not on the menu, 
			just ask and as long as we have the proper ingredients, our chefs will make it for you! Don't be shy our
			kitchen staff loves being challenged!</p>

			<p><h3>About the Garden:</p></h3>
			<p>Growing Green Eatery employs three full time gardeners who fertilize, water, weed, harvest, and prepare the produce we grow for cooking. 
			No pesticides are used, which results in organic, healthy dishes.  Only the best for our customers!</center></p></td>
