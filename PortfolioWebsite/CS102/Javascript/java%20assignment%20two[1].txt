CS-175: Java Assignment 2

Deadline: Fri, 11/4, 6pm

Insert your answers below the following questions and save this file in the
cs175-java-assignments dropbox. Use a plain text editor such as notepad++ or
jedit, NOT a word processor. For questions #7 and #8, turn in the Java
programs separately.

(The following are textbook Chapter 3 Exercises, pp. 188-189.)

1. Write a fragment of code that will test whether an integer variable called
   score contains a valid test score. Valid test scores are in the range 0 to
   100.
   

	if (score >= 0 && score <= 100)
	{
	   System.out.println("This score is Valid.");
	}
	else
	{
	   System.out.println("This score is not valid.");
	}



2. Write a fragment of code that will change the integer value that is stored
   in the variable x as follows. If x contains an even number, divide x by 2.
   If x contains an odd number, multiply x by 3 and then subtract 1.


	if (x % 2 == int)
	{
	   (x % 2)
	}
	else
	{
	   ((x * 3) - 1)
	}



3. Consider the following fragment of code:

      if (x > 5)
         System.out.println("A");
      else if (x < 10)
         System.out.println("B");
      else
         System.out.println("C");

   What is printed if the variable x above contains:

      a. 4 -- B

      b. 5 -- B

      c. 6 -- A

      d. 9 -- A

      e. 10 -- A

      f. 11 -- A





4. Consider the following fragment of code:

      if (x > 5)
      {
         System.out.println("A");

         if (x < 10)
            System.out.println("B");
      }
      else
         System.out.println("C");

   What is printed if the variable x above contains:

      a. 4 -- C

      b. 5 -- C

      c. 6 -- AB

      d. 9 -- AB

      e. 10 -- A

      f. 11 -- A






5. What is the value (true or false) of each of the following boolean
   expressions if x is 5, y is 10, and z is 15?

   a. (x < 5 && y > x) -- false

   b. (x < 5 || y > x) -- true

   c. (x > 3 || y < 10 && z == 15) -- true

   d. ( !(x > 3) && (x != z) || (x + y == z) ) -- true





6. What will be printed by the following code fragment?

      int x = 200;

      if ((x > 10) || (x < 100))
         System.out.println("x is between 10 and 100.");
      else
         System.out.println("x is not between 10 and 100.");


	      
	x is between 10 and 100.
  



7. Complete the ValidTriangles.java program from Java Lab 2
   (http://tinyurl.com/7vetl6k). Save and turn in ValidTriangles.java as a
   separate file in the ecampus dropbox.




8. Based on the LargestOfThree.java program from Java Lab 2
   (http://tinyurl.com/7vetl6k), write a program called LargestSmallest.java
   that inputs 5 integers from the user and finds the largest and smallest of
   the input integers. Make sure the program can handle ties in the values
   input by the user. Save and turn in LargestSmallest.java as a separate file
   in the ecampus dropbox.
