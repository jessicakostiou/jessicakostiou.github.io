	<p><h4>  	A significant barrier preventing robots from frequent use is human acceptance and perception.  One way to improve this relationship
	 is to implement more human-like characteristics in robots to make them less intimidating to users.  This is a comparative study
	which matches participant interactions with two robots (cute vs un-cute) moving about the same room at the same time.  The objective
	of this research is to determine whether personality type and preference increase interaction between a robot and its user.  The initial
	hypothesis is that the more a personality appeals to the user the more likely the user is to be engaged in the interaction.  It was also
	theorized that the robot with the personality appealing most to participants should receive the most helping behaviors and achieve its goal first.</h4></p>
	<br>
	<p><h4>	There were two robots with different personas used in this experiment, Robbie (cute) and Eibbor (un-cute.)  The goal was for the robots to get "home"
		 to a location specified in the room.  Theoretically the robot that had the biggest connection with
		participants would reach home first. Participants were measured by helping behaviors directed at the robots captured on video, and by a post-experiment survey.
		  After data analysis was completed it was determined that Robbie had a higher interaction rate and interest level overall.  For more specifics of the experiment,
			please refer to the document and interview below!
