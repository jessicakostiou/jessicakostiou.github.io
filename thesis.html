	<h2>Synthetic Personality in Robots</h2>

	<p><h4> Currently involved in research with Dr. Allen Milewski, a Software Engineering professor at Monmouth University.  
	This is a study based on

	 <a href="http://www.tweenbots.com"> The Tweenbot Project</a> 
	 
	 conducted at the Museum of Modern Art in NYC. Individuals will be observed
	 to see if they are more inclined to help a robot who is more visually appealing and extroverted vs. a bland and introverted 
	 robot. Human interactions will be video recorded.  Individuals not originally associated with the experiment 
	 will be asked to view short clips of subjects interacting with the robot from both cases,
	 and guess to which condition it pertains.  The individuals should get more and more accurate in their guesses each time.  
	 At the end of this exercise the steady-state peak correctness will be charted and determined.  This will ultimately show if 
	 there is a difference between the two conditions of cute and un-cute.   This experiment will be accompanied by an in-depth
	 analysis on Human Robot Interaction that can be read below.  This study will be occurring in Fall'2014 and will be presented at 
	 the Monmouth University Honours Research Conference in Spring '15.</h4></p>
