		<h2>Cute and Un-Cute Robots</h2>

		<p><h4>This project was a precursor to my honours thesis.  This course explored introductory level programming and applied it to Scribbler S2 Robots.
		The goal of this final project was to design two modes to one robot, one being cute and the other being un-cute.
		This was accomplished by programming the robot with varying assortments of movements, light signals, and sounds.  The different personalities 
		were then be tested in public and observed to see how humans interact based on the mode the robot is set on.</p></h4>
		<p><h4>Prior to programming, requirements, use cases and test cases were completed to serve as guidelines for how the project would be created.  This helped 
		outline the differences between the two different modes being programmed.</p></h4>
