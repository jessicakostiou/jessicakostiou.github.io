		<p><h4>According to our client Invisible Wound, 22 Veterans a day commit suicide due to the effects of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
			Often friends and loved ones have a hard time understanding the way veterans act in response to specific situations, and do not know how to help.
			Specifically children of veterans can sometimes struggle with understanding the actions of their parents, and why they may be unable to participate
			in certain activities with their children.
			<br>
			<br>
			The goal of Battlemind is to work in conjunction with three students from the Music and Art departments at Monmouth University to create a web-based
			video game that will serve as an educational tool for our client Invisible Wound.  It is an interactive and educational application to place the player
			in the shoes of an individual that has PTSD, which will ultimately help educate their family and friends.
			<br>
			<br>
			The player will create a schedule of daily events that the character has to perform.  Some levels include seemingly simple every-day tasks such as
			grocery shopping, driving your kids to school and going to the movies.  The player is confronted with a series of triggers that someone with PTSD might
			incur in these situations.  The game will also display facts about PTSD, and suggest coping mechanisms for each situation.  Ultimately this game will help
			spread awareness of PTSD and its effects on veterans of war.  </p></h4>

			<br><h4>Mission:
			<br>Our client Invisible Wound is a charitable organization which empowers warriors suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder to take an active role in their
			recovery and reintegration process. Their secondary mission consists of educating the public about issues surrounding post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
			<br>

			<br>About the Organization:
			<br>A volunteer based organization, the Invisible Wound, Ltd. team seeks to offer a variety of programs and opportunities for sufferers of PTSD and their
			support networks. Through donation and sponsorship, these programs are to be provided free of cost to the Warrior and their families.</h4>
