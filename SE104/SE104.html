<h2>Final Project</h2>
<h3>Scribbler S2 Robot</h3>
<br>
<h3>About the Project:</h3>
<h4>  
<p>This project was a precursor to my honors thesis.  This course explored introductory level programing and applied it to Scribbler S2 Robots.
The goal of this final project was to design two modes to one robot, one being cute and the other being un-cute.
This was accomplished by programming the robot with varying assortments of movements, light signals, and sounds.  The different “personalities” 
were then be tested in public and observed to see how humans interact based on the mode the robot is set on.</h4>
